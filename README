# xtools - a few helpers for working with XBPS

These are a bunch of small utilities for use with XBPS:
https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps

  xbarf - display build logs of last build
  xbulk [-n] [-k] [xbps-src flags...] PKGS... - simple XBPS bulk builder
  xbump PKGNAME [git commit options] - git commit a version bump
  xcheckrestart [-v] - list programs using outdated libraries
  xclash - detect file conflicts between XBPS packages
  xdbg PKGS... - list debugging packages for PKGS and recursive dependencies
  xdiff [-u|-l] [DIR] - merge/diff/list XBPS .new-* files
  xdistdir - figure out XBPS_DISTDIR
  xdowngrade PKGS.xbps... - install XBPS package directly from .xbps file
  xetcchanges - show diff of /etc against binary packages
  xgensum [-f] [-i] TEMPLATE - update SHA256 sums in templates
  xgrep PATTERN PKGS... - search files limited to XBPS package contents
  xhog - list installed XBPS packages ordered by size
  xi PKGS... - like xbps-install -S, but take cwd repo and sudo/su into account
  xilog [PATTERN] - list installed packages by install-date
  xlg PKG - open short commit log for XBPS template
  xlint TEMPLATE - scan XBPS template for common mistakes
  xlocate [-u | -g | PATTERN] - locate files in all XBPS packages
  xlog PKG - open commit log for XBPS template
  xls PKGS... - list files contained in PKGS (including binpkgs)
  xmandoc MANPAGE - read manpage of possibly not installed package
  xmindep PKGS... - minimize list of PKGS by removing implicit dependencies
  xmypkgs [EMAIL] - list all pkgs maintained by you (or EMAIL)
  xnew PKG - create XBPS template template
  xnodev - list not installed -devel packages for installed packages
  xoptdiff [-q] [PKGS...] - show template options which differ from binary package
  xpkg [-RamOHvV] - convenient package lister
  xpstree - display tree view of xbps-src processes
  xq [-R] PKGS... - query information about XBPS package
  xrecent [REPOURL|XBPS_ARCH] - list packages in repo ordered by build date
  xrevbump MESSAGE TEMPLATES... - increase template revision and commit
  xrevshlib PACKAGE - list packages shlib-dependent on PACKAGE or its subpkgs
  xrs PATTERN - like xbps-query -Rs, but take cwd repo into account
  xsrc PKG - list source files for XBPS template
  xsubpkg [-m] PKG - lists all subpackages of a package

Tools working on the void-packages tree use xdistdir to find it,
check its output is reasonable first.

xi, xls, xq, xrs prefer the hostdir/binpkgs repo if you run them from
a void-packages checkout.
