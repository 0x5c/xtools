# xtools - a few helpers for working with XBPS

These are a few small utilities for use with XBPS:
https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps

  gensum [-i] TEMPLATE - update SHA256 sums in templates
  mindep PKGS... - minimize list of PKGS by removing implicit dependencies
  xbump PKGNAME [git commit options] - git commit a version bump
  xdiff [DIR] - merge XBPS .new-* files
  xgrep PATTERN PKGS... - search files limited to XBPS package contents
  xlg PKG - open short commit log for XBPS template
  xlocate PATTERN - locate files in all XBPS packages
  xlog PKG - open commit log for XBPS template
  xls PKGS... - list files contained in PKGS (including binpkgs)
  xnuxnu PKG - upstream version checker for XBPS templates
  xq PKGS... - query information about XBPS package
  xsrc PKG - list source files for XBPS template

A few tools assume xbps-packages is checked out at ~/xbps-packages.
