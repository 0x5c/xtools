These are a few small utilities for use with XBPS:
https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps

  xbulk [-n] [-k] [-xbps_src_flags] PKG... - simple XBPS bulk builder
  xbump PKGNAME [git commit options] - git commit a version bump
  xdiff [-u] [DIR] - merge XBPS .new-* files
  xgensum [-i] TEMPLATE - update SHA256 sums in templates
  xgrep PATTERN PKGS... - search files limited to XBPS package contents
  xlg PKG - open short commit log for XBPS template
  xlocate PATTERN - locate files in all XBPS packages
  xlog PKG - open commit log for XBPS template
  xls PKGS... - list files contained in PKGS (including binpkgs)
  xmindep PKGS... - minimize list of PKGS by removing implicit dependencies
  xnuxnu PKG - upstream version checker for XBPS templates
  xoptdiff [-q] [PKGS...] - show template options which differ from binary package
  xq PKGS... - query information about XBPS package

A few tools assume xbps-packages is checked out at ~/xbps-packages.
